Had the same issue and running this command fixed it for me:
On the Domain Controller run:
DCDiag /Fix
Then restart the NetLogon service
Now when you go back to the DNS admin UI all your 'missing underscore folders' should have been rebuilt.

A good test to validate that your DC can be resolved is run this command from any windows workstation/server:

nltest /dsgetdc:<your Domain Controller Domain>
